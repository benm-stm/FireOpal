INSTALLATION
============

Before installing, you need to understand that this code deals with three different machines:
1- The machine from which you may launch tests having a webserver on which this code is deployed. Let's call it "Launcher machine".
2- The machine on which web application to be tested is deployed. Let's call it "Server machine".
3- The machine from which tests will be launched, we use a web browser installed on it. Let's call it "Client machine".

On Launcher machine:

    Install a webserver that supports php
    Install ruby & rubygems
    Then install RSpec & selenium-webdriver by

    > gem install selenium-webdriver
    > gem install rspec

    Put this code on that machine and point the root of the webserver on "www" folder

On Client machine:

    You need to download selenium-server-standalone-x.y.z.jar from http://seleniumhq.org/download

    If you use firefox for tests then create a Firefox profile for selenium (you may need to delete extentions.rdf for addons popup)

    After that and before trying to run any tests you need to open the platform to be tested by the firefox profile and accept the certificate

    Then run Selenium by

    > java -jar selenium-server-standalone-x.y.z.jar -singlewindow -firefoxProfileTemplate "/path/to/firefox/profile/"
    Selenium RC must be always running on client machine as a service to make launching tests from launcher machine possible.

    For browsers other than firefox the first test may cause an SSL certificate issue.
    For that add the option -trustAllSSLCertificates when you run Selenium

    To keep the same session for all tests add the option -browserSessionReuse

RUN TESTS
=========

You probably need to modify tests settings in conf/set.php file. (Not used for the moment)

You can run a testsuite in command line by just typing:
> ruby testsuite.rb

Or using web interface by selecting the testsuite you want to run then Run
